**scBASE** is a python implementation of three-component Beta-Binomial mixture model for accurate quantitation of allele-specific expression (ASE) from scRNA-Seq data. Initially we meant to develop Zero- and One-Inflated Beta-Binomial (ZOIBB) model for ASE, but we found it too stringent and improved stability by making it "soft" zero- and "soft" one-inflated model. Stay tuned!
